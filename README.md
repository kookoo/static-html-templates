static-html-site-templates
=====================

The idea was to implement templating system for static site generation using simple python script and known templation lib (like Mustache)

Known implementations:
 * [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) on Ruby, [Hyde](https://github.com/lakshmivyas/hyde/) clone on Python, last commit a year ago 
 * [Jinja](http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/templates/)
 * [Django-bakery](https://github.com/datadesk/django-bakery)
